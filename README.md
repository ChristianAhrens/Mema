MenuBarMatrix is a programming experiment to try out how a macOS menu bar tool can be made that provides audio matrix routing functionality using JUCE framework - e.g. to route BlackHole 16ch virtual device to system output to overcome Apple's ridiculous 16ch-for-Music-Atmos-Output requirement'.

Its sourcecode and prebuilt binaries are made publicly available to enable interested users to experiment, extend and create own adaptations.
